Ported the mod to a lot more versions and refactored a ton of things.
If all is well, the next release should be 1.0.0-stable and this mod goes out of beta.

If you find any bugs, please [report them here](https://github.com/FlooferLand/ttvoice-mod/issues/new).

The stable release should be out very soon.
